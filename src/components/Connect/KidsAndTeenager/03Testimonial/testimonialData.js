    review:
      "Hare Krishna Mata ji, I am the father of Aradhya Ghiya, these classes are really eye opener and I found so many positive changes in my child. Today he do 4 mala of hare Krishna every day, he touches feet of elders, he help in household works, he is more humble and determined. We all left eating onion and garlic permanently just because of him. His concepts of spirituality are so strong and logical that he faces any one and has all the answers. Your classes are so amazing that a child learns tough geeta shlokas so easily by interest which even we as parents can't make them do. I am so proud that my child is in your hand and his future is definitely bright and beautiful.",
